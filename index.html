                From a young age, I have had a passion for engineering.
                This started in second grade when I joined the infamous, “Washing Machine Disassembly Club” or WMDC.
                It consisted of a group of twenty children, each armed with a hammer and screwdriver, an unfortunate
                supervising teacher, and an even more unfortunate washing machine. Upon the teacher’s say so, we would
                subject this washing machine to every form of punishment available, hoping to take it apart.  I learned
                very little learning about washing machines, however, it did awaken an urge inside me to understand how things work.
                I quickly grew bored of the WMDC and began disassembling (mostly) unused household appliances
                like DVD players. As much as the hardware of my victims fascinated me, I was always drawn to the software. When I dissasembled a product, I could more or less piece together how the hardware worked. The software, however, remained a mystery to me. I believe it was this process of trying to understand how technology worked that lead to my enthusiasm for programming.
